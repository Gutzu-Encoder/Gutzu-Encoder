## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Gutzu-Encoder/Gutzu-Encoder** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Krityotch Manowatthanakul, Nick name: Guts

I'm a medical student at Ramathibodi Hospital (Class of 2024), Mahidol University, Thailand.
Altho I'm a med student, I'm a fond of ML, DL.

I'm interested in 
- NLP: especially clinical language modeling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), medical decision support systems and AI tools that improve clinical workflows and reduce physician burden.
- Computer vision: with a focus on medical imaging and analysis, segmentation (U-Net), and diagnostic aid systems.
